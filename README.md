The Neighborhood Map application to highlight points of interests for selected location. The application reinforces learnings from the Udacity FEND course.  The some of the react topics include building react components, routing, states, props, linking and Asynchronous API Requests. The application allows a user to search through venues, view on Google maps and check out FOURSQUARE iunformation.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
* Build project `npm run build`
* serve -s build
* Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in the browser.


## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
